After opening your console/terminal window, you can invoke the compiler program called by the simple command 

cc mysource.c

where cc is the C compiler and mysource.c is the name of the source file.(gcc is a very widespread compiler, if you are using it,just change the command of gcc.)The output of this command will be  a binary executable file called a.out,which you can rename(using mv) if you want.

For more practical uses, you can output the binary executable to a different file,using 
'-o...'(just as in CSound'-o' means "output to"):

cc -o myprogr mysource.c

On Windows machines your program filename will have the extension .exe On other systems no extensions are used.
