0.2 Building C programs
	
	0.2.1 Compiled and interpreted languages

	C is what we call a compiled language.This is because of the programs written with C code in a text file, are generated by a package of programs called the compiler.These programs transform the text code into binary codes that are understood by the machine and the operating system.The process of compilation/program building is discussed below.

		Interpreted languages,such as Python, are generally higher-level languages that are dependent on an interpreter program,which translates the text code into machine action directly.
	Their advantage is that the result of the programming can be seen immediately.On the other hand,generally speaking,the overhead of interpreting the code can make these languages very inneficient for intensive tasks(such as calculating the output of a synthesis routine, in the case of a music system).
