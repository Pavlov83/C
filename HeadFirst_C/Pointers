There are three things that we need to know in order to use pointers
to read and write data.

1.Get the address of a variable(using the '&' operator).
		
		%p format will print out the location in hex(base 16)format

		int x = 4;
		printf("x lives at %p\n", &n);

 	if we want to store it,we will need a pointer variable.

 		int *address_of_x = &x;

2. Read the contents of an address:
	When you have a memory address you will want to read the data that
	is stored there.You do that with the * operator:

		int value_stored = *address_of_x;

3.Change the contents of an address:

		*address_of_x = 99;
