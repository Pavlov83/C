To create a C program, you need a text file with extension .c which conatins source code.

#include<stdio.h>    This is the include section which is in the begining of most of the C programs.In this example we are including stdio which gives us the ability to read from the console.

The next thing that you will find in a source file are the functions.
All the C code runs in functions.The most important function is main(),this is where your program starts.The main() is mandatory,without it the program execution will not start.

int main()
{
	int decks;
	puts("Enter a number of decks");
	scanf("i", &decks);
	if(decks < 1){
	puts("Thats is not valid number of decks");
	return 1;
	}
	printf("There are %i cards\n",(decks * 52));
	return 0;
}

The body of the function is always surrounded by braces.
The function name comes after the return type : int main()

printf() function is used to display formatted output.It replaces format
characters with the values of variables, like this:

printf("%s says the count is %i","Ben", 21);
