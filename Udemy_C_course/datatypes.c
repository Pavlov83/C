/*
    Basic datatypes in C are :
int
float
double
char
_Bool

*/

// Variable of type int can be used to contain values that don"t have decimal place.

//A minus sign preceding the datatype and vatiable indicates that the value is negative

//The int type is a signed integer,it can be positive,negative or zero.

// if an integer is preceded by a zero and the letter x(either lowercase or uppercase),
//the value is taken as being expressed in hexadecimal(base 16) notation e.g. int rgbColor = 0xFFEF0D;

//the values 158 -10, p and are all valid examples of integer constants
//no embedded spaces are permitted between digits
//values larger than 999 cannot be expressed using commas(12,000 must be written as 12 000)

// A variable of type float can be used for storing floating-point numbers
//the values 3., 125.8, and - .0001 are all valid examples or floating point constants that can be assigned to a variable
