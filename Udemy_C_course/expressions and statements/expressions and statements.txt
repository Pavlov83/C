Statements form the basic program steps of C, and most statements are constructed from expressions.

An expression consists of a combination of operators and operands.

Operands are what an operator operates on

Operands can be constants,variables or combinations of the two

Every expression has a value

Statements are the bulding blocks of a program(declaration)
A program is a series of statements with special syntax ending with a semicolon(simple statement)

Declaration statement e.g.  int Jason;
Assignment Statement e.g. Jason = 5;
Function call statement e.g. printf("Jason");
Structure Statement: while(Jason < 20) Jason = Jason + 1;
Return Statement: return 0;

C considers any expression to be a statement if you append a semicolon(expression statements)

So 8; and 3-4; are perfectly valid in C

Compound Statements are two or more statements grouped together by enclosing them in braces(block)

int index = 0;
while(index < 10)
{
	printf("hello");
	index = index + 1;
}
